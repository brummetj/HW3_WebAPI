## Why shouldn't oAuth Tokens be granted in the main flow?
--
This is because there is a security issue if a access toke is stored in the main flow of the app. Its not necessary a good idea to store the token in the main app because it is not a safe space. Storing a access token in the main flow would be allow a hack that could happen, which would require higher security, which would require more unneccassry work.
